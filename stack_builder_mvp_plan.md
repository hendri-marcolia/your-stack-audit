# Stack Builder MVP Plan

## 1. Define the scope of the MVP:

*   Basic drag-and-drop component placement and linking.
*   LLM prompt-based component suggestion and placement.
*   A set of basic components (e.g., server, database, firewall).
*   Display of CVEs associated with components (using dummy data for now).
*   Simple stack saving and loading functionality.

## 2. Technology Stack:

*   Frontend: React, TypeScript, a drag-and-drop library (e.g., react-dnd).
*   Backend: Node.js, Express.js.
*   LLM Integration: Use a placeholder for the LLM integration for now.
*   Data Storage: JSON file for storing stack configurations.

## 3. Frontend Implementation:

*   Create a React component for the drag-and-drop interface.
*   Implement the component palette with basic components.
*   Implement the canvas area where components can be placed and linked.
*   Implement the LLM prompt input and suggestion display.
*   Implement the component properties panel.
*   Implement the stack saving and loading functionality.

## 4. Backend Implementation:

*   Create an Express.js API endpoint for receiving LLM prompts and returning component suggestions.
*   Create an API endpoint for saving and loading stack configurations.

## 5. LLM Integration (Placeholder):

*   Create a placeholder function that returns a list of suggested components based on a prompt.
*   Replace the placeholder with actual LLM integration later.

## 6. CVE Data (Dummy Data):

*   Create a JSON file with dummy CVE data for the basic components.
*   Display the CVE data in the component properties panel.

## 7. Testing:

*   Test the drag-and-drop functionality.
*   Test the LLM prompt-based suggestion functionality.
*   Test the stack saving and loading functionality.

## 8. Deployment:

*   Deploy the frontend to a static hosting service (e.g., Netlify, Vercel).
*   Deploy the backend to a Node.js hosting service (e.g., Heroku, AWS).
