## üõ°Ô∏è SecArch: Visual Infrastructure Modeling with Real-Time CVE Intelligence

SecArch is a next-gen platform for security-aware infrastructure modeling. It empowers engineers and DevSecOps teams to:

- Design infrastructure visually using **drag-and-drop components**.
- Use **natural language (NLP/LLM prompts)** to accelerate architecture modeling.
- Automatically scan and **correlate known vulnerabilities (CVEs)** to components.
- Receive **real-time threat alerts** as new CVEs are published (e.g., CISA KEV).
- Get **human-readable impact analysis and remediation suggestions**.

---

## üéØ Why SecArch?

Modern infrastructure evolves fast. Most teams:
- Lack up-to-date stack documentation.
- Struggle with CVE tracking across environments.
- Discover risks reactively ‚Äî only after a breach or audit.

SecArch solves this by treating your architecture as a living, intelligence-aware blueprint.

## üîç Core Features

- **Hybrid Stack Design**: Combine drag-and-drop UI with GPT-style prompts to build cloud-native, hybrid, or legacy stack diagrams.
- **Real-Time CVE Threat Intelligence**: Automatically syncs with sources like [CISA KEV](https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog) to match stack components against high-priority threats.
- **Explainable Alerts**: LLM-generated summaries of risk, impact, and actionable remediation guidance.
- **Version-Aware Correlation Engine**: Matches CVEs with specific components and versions (where declared or inferred).

---

## üîå Planned Integrations

- **[ThreatMapper](https://github.com/deepfence/ThreatMapper)** (OSS):
  - Runtime CVE scanning for cloud workloads and containers.
  - Enhances SecArch with live infra validation.
- **SBOM Support**: Import Software Bill of Materials from projects to increase precision.
- **IaC Support**: Ingest Terraform/Kubernetes manifests to auto-generate stack diagrams.
- **Slack/Teams Integration**: Get notified when your stack is affected by a new CVE.

---

## üß™ Demo Considerations

For initial presentations (e.g., IDNOG):
- Focus on the **stack modeling experience** and show how real CVEs (e.g., Log4Shell) get caught in modeled components.
- Keep the UI clean and responsive ‚Äî avoid complex flows until stability is confirmed.
- Highlight **LLM prompt to component mapping** and allow edits.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitations

- **LLM Hallucination Risk**:
  - LLMs can infer incorrect software versions or components from ambiguous prompts.
  - Mitigation: Allow manual overrides, show version uncertainty explicitly.

- **CVE Matching Granularity**:
  - Some vulnerabilities require precise versioning, OS, or config metadata.
  - Mitigation: Add optional version input fields and dependency graphs.

- **Security Source Reliance**:
  - Currently focuses on KEV; expanding to NVD and other curated sources is on the roadmap.

## üìà Roadmap

- [ ] MVP: Stack builder + basic CVE matcher (KEV)
- [ ] LLM Prompt-to-Component interpreter with validation
- [ ] ThreatMapper integration
- [ ] SBOM and IaC import
- [ ] Team collaboration (multi-user stack editing)
- [ ] CVE drift and timeline tracking
- [ ] Open source community release

## üìú License
TBD (likely MIT or Apache 2.0 for community adoption)

---

## ü§ù Contributions
Planned to be open for community involvement once core MVP is live. Suggestions, PRs, and integrations welcome.
